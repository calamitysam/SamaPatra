### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash

   - Other settings as needed

5. Create the database:
   ```bash
   createdb samapatra
   ```

6. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   psql -d samapatra -f src/db/schema.sql
   ```

### Development

Start the development server with hot reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production

Build and run:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Database Schema

See `src/db/schema.sql` for the complete schema.

Main tables:
- `users` - Teachers, students, admins
- `students` - Student profiles with accessibility needs
- `classes` - Teacher's classes
- `class_enrollments` - Student enrollments
- `questions` - Base question bank
- `question_versions` - Translated/adapted versions
- `papers` - Generated exam papers
- `answers` - Student answers
- `adaptive_test_results` - Adaptive test results
- `ai_cache` - Cached AI responses

## AI Provider Architecture

The backend uses an abstraction layer for AI providers, making it easy to swap models or providers:

```typescript
interface AIProvider {
  generateText(prompt: string, options?: GenerateOptions): Promise<string>;
  generateStructured<T>(prompt: string, schema: any, options?: GenerateOptions): Promise<T>;
  estimateTokens(text: string): number;
}
```

Current implementation uses Google Gemini API. To add a new provider:
1. Implement the `AIProvider` interface
2. Update `createAIProvider()` in `src/services/ai/gemini.ts`

## Security

- All AI calls go through the backend - API key never exposed to clients
- Student names and personal details are anonymized before sending to AI
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- PostgreSQL parameterized queries prevent SQL injection

## Performance

- AI response caching reduces costs and latency
- Rate limiting with retry and exponential backoff
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Connection pooling for database

## Testing

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```
